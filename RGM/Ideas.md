This file is very out of scope, but I had a few ideas and wanted to write them down. 

Let's go.

**Plot**

Basically you're some sort of a ~~junkie~~ rogue fighter trying to get an artifact which is stored on top of an interdimensional (something like the Citadel from Rick and Morty) tower/skyscraper/complex. 

**Main Loop**

Main loop is basically taken from the original Isaac, likely simplified (at least at first), possibly changes and expanded.

1. Spawn in a random dungeon
2. Kill baddies, get loot (at least hearts)
3. Get items from item rooms
4. Kill the boss
5. Get a gun from the boss

Why give guns only for killing a boss you might ask?

a) Items are usually easier to make, balance and can create cool builds. 
I'd very much like to bring this feeling of building your character from Isaac here.

b) I don't want to get rid of guns totally, because I have no idea what else can you use to shoot
(I have no idea why someone though that shooting with tears is a good idea but apparently it works).

c) I don't want to get rid of guns because they're cool, and enemies with guns are even cooler and also easier to make in concept.
(If your main character is shooting with tears then how are you supposed to be attacked by, let's say, military?)

**Floors**

*Curio R&D Department* 

- Office themed floor with all kinds of office workers trying to take you down.
- Many games seem to be omitting a good old shootout in the office, and I think that'd be cool.
- The name is kind of ironic cause you can't invent a curio.
- We could also add some actual artifacts or enemies using them to kill you here.

*Monster's Belly*

- You're inside of some sort of a huge monster, like a whale.
- Enemies are themed from immune system's cells, and boss could be a heart or something.

*Guncave*

- Enter the Gungeon themed floor.
- Probably won't be a thing because of copyright, I will change the name of the game too.

**Bosses**

*Competitive baby, master of natural selection*

Baby boss, probably easy. Taken from r/Bossfight.

**Inspirations I don't want to forget about**

Gameplay and enemy design - Enter the Gungeon, The Binding of Isaac, ATIC ATAC

Naming - Newspeak (Orwell)
